You need to run the first code block in test1.ipynb in order to produce the data in the outputs dir.

Test2.ipynb is the neural network test

test_network.ipynb - neural network prediction test for network changes from scenario

distancedata.ipynb - plots distributions of time and KM distances in the QUANT distance matrices

connections.ipynb - this tests what happens to the connectivity of the UK if you ramp the scenario radius from 1KM up to 30KM.
Produces an aggregate table of number of disconnected zones, plus a csv file of number of out connections by MSOA for mapping.
